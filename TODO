# TODO

## IMPORTANT

## Figure out file name collisions between commands

`get-dhcphosts` and `get-zonefiles` both produce files named after zones/domains, which causes a collision if they output to the same directory. Use separate destdirs by default?

### Remove old requirements

* `iso8601`
* `requests`

### Top-level exception handler

Add a top level exception handler that catches all unhandled exceptions and logs them, so we have a log trail if something goes wrong. Should not catch `SystemExit`, since `exit_err` already logs (change this?).

## General

### LDIF Options

Add LDIF CLI options to LDIF commands:

* --dn
* --cn
* --ou
* --description
* --objectclass

* Use `pathvalidate` to validate and sanitize file paths in config and commands.

### Old files

Should we store old files in a separate directory instead of appending `_old` to the filename? This would make it easier to compare old and new files, and avoid cluttering the output directory with old files.

### Separate default output directories for different commands

Commands such as `get-zonefiles` and `get-dhcphosts` should have separate default output directories to avoid file name collisions and make it easier to manage the output files.

## Commands

### hosts-ldif

* Add filtering by zone (unused in prod, but existed in old script)
